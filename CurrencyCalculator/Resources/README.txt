-This calculator is intended specifically for people wanting to convert USD to the Venezuelan Bolivar, due to the rising number of Venezuelan refugees
	arriving to the US. In future versions, there might be a simultaneous conversion to Pesos Colombianos.
- I'm unsure of the conversion to VEF, but to Colombian pesos, my guess is about 2800 to 3000 COP to 1 dollar.
- NOTE: Western Union's website offered no conversion rate to VEF from USD; in fact, money transfer services are unavailable.

-Challenges: 
	-Every website offers a slightly different conversion rate for currencies. I plan on placing a few options for rates when making calculations:
		- If available, Western Union
		- Results that appear at the top of a Google search results page
		- maybe xe.com?
		- If possible, reputable institutions located/based in Colombia/Venezuela
		- Allow the users to access the websites involved to find the most accurate/current conversion rates and use them in the calculator--
			A "manual mode", if you will.
		- An average of these rates, so users can receive a general idea as to how much money the recipient should get.
	-As with every nation, socioeconomic circumstances may affect the stability/volatility of currency conversion rates. In later versions, I would
	like to have the program obtain conversion rate updates on a daily/weekly basis for best accuracy, but I'm not sure how to implement that at this point.

- NOTE: Because these are estimates, there should be a disclaimer letting the user know that there is no full guarantee that the rates/values 
	should be considered as exact; users should allow for a margin of error when using the calculator/sending money. Also, they should consider fees
	involved when using some services to send money (like sending to/from a debit card, bank account, etc.)
	-THIS CALCULATOR CANNOT BY ITSELF SEND THE USER'S MONEY TO SOME INTENDED RECIPIENT. Nor do I intend on implementing such functionality.
